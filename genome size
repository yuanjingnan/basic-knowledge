Why do genomes vary in size?
In 1991, John W. Drake proposed a general rule: that the mutation rate within a genome and its size are inversely correlated. This rule has been found to be approximately correct for simple genomes such as those in DNA viruses and unicellular organisms. Its basis is unknown.
"Mutation rate within a genome and its sizes are inversely correlated" is to say that when mutation rate is higher and its genome size is smaller.
